BootlintThisPage-Chrome
=======================

Use this Chrome extension to inject the Bootlint tool into a web page and automatically scan it for common Bootstrap related errors.

Adds a single click Bootlint This Page button which will execute the bootlint.js script against the current page.

If errors are found then bootlint.js will generate a JavaScript alert and the errors will be displayed in the JavaScript console window.

To view the errors simply press F12 to bring up the developer tools and then click the console tab.

**Note: This extension is not affiliated with the official Bootlint or Bootstrap projects.**

What Is Bootlint?
=================
Bootlint is a tool that was released by the Bootstrap team in order to catch errors in sites built with their Bootstrap framework. The official announcement blog posts describes it as:

"An HTML linting tool for projects using vanilla Bootstrap. Using Bootlint you can automatically check your Bootstrapped webpages for many common Bootstrap usage mistakes."

Bookmarklet Alternative
=======================
The Bootlint team have incorporated my idea into the project as an official way to use their tool. 

In the process some of the code was changed (eg auto-lint-on-load was disabled) so my original bookmarklet no longer works and has been removed. 

Please [visit the official Bootlint documentation](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint#in-the-browser) for more information about how you can now use the bookmarklet.
